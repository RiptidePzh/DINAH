## Event-Driven Backtesting Platform

Before we delve into development of such a backtester we need to understand the concept of event-driven systems. Video games provide a natural use case for event-driven software and provide a straightforward example to explore. A video game has multiple components that interact with each other in a real-time setting at high framerates. This is handled by running the entire set of calculations within an "infinite" loop known as the event-loop or game-loop.

At each tick of the game-loop a function is called to receive the latest event, which will have been generated by some corresponding prior action within the game. Depending upon the nature of the event, which could include a key-press or a mouse click, some subsequent action is taken, which will either terminate the loop or generate some additional events. The process will then continue. Here is some example pseudo-code:

```python
while True:  # Run the loop forever
    new_event = get_new_event()   # Get the latest event

    # Based on the event type, perform an action
    if new_event.type == "LEFT_MOUSE_CLICK":
        open_menu()
    elif new_event.type == "ESCAPE_KEY_PRESS":
        quit_game()
    elif new_event.type == "UP_KEY_PRESS":
        move_player_north()
    # ... and many more events

    redraw_screen()   # Update the screen to provide animation
    tick(50)   # Wait 50 milliseconds
    
```
